VirToys Sequence Script Manual. v1.0
Developed by Downy Swain (2024)

First of all, thanks must to be given to all those who tested this device.
A very special thank you goes out to Amea Aya of Vexation, for help with RLV, and our friends in Coghaven, 
who deployed the first production model of the factory, and helped get this product out to the door, and into your hands!

********************
* How does it work? *
********************

All that is required from the victim... err.. subject is the use of an RLV viewer such as Restrained Love or Emerald, 
a recent RLV relay, and a #RLV folder in inventory.  
The use of the Susan's Relay is recommended, as testing has shown it produces the best results.

************************
* Can it be customized?  *
************************

YES! Here's how it works:
The factory is made of a number of sections, that each has a program. 
When activated, the section runs through the program, line by line. 
The last line in the program activates the next section - and so on, until the last section. 

The first section is a special case: It has a capture function, and checks if the user is using a RLV viewer. 
If yes, the user is given a folder that contains some items used by the factory, and a default avatar.
It also determines which avatar the user is to be turned into. 
This is done by querying the user's #RLV folder, to see if there's a folder that matches some keywords.
So, for instance, if 'Rubberdoll' is set as a keyword, and the user has a #RLV folder named 'Rubberdoll', 
that folder will be selected. 
If there's more than one folder that matches the keywords, an random one of those will be selected. 
If there's no match, the default doll avatar will be used.

Since it's not one big build, but made of sections, you can put them together any which way you like. 

Want to turn the user into a pink elephant or a terminator robot?
Actually, you can.... but you may have to modify the whole factory to fit the process. 
You may even have to write your own plug-in scripts, and build your own sections. 
But if you really want to, you can.
